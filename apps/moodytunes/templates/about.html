    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Welcome to MoodyTunes! This site is aimed to answer a simply worded, but curious question: How does music affect
    people's emotions? Through analysis of song metadata and understanding user usage of the site, we can collect data
    to make an informed guess to an answer to that question, and also help you (the user) better understand your perception
    of the songs you listen to.</p>
    <p>Through interacting with the site, you can build playlists of songs that you believe make you feel certain emotions.
    You start by browsing for songs for a given emotion, like "Happy" or "Melancholy". You can optionally provide a context
    to grant greater insight to the circumstances involved in your music listening session. This can help you understand
    the difference in emotion given a certain environment (maybe you find certain songs exciting a party, but calm when
    you're by yourself.) We automatically add songs you upvote to your playlist for that emotion, so you can quickly view
    your collection of songs that you believe make you feel a specific emotion.</p>

    <h3>Operation</h3>
    <p>The site works by analyzing certain metadata about songs. Currently, we analyze the valence and energy of tracks.
    We use the <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify API</a> to gather this information
    for use in our site operation. Roughly speaking, valence denotes the mood of the song while energy marks the intensity
    of the song. As you vote on songs for a particular emotion, we use that information to better understand your personal
    ranges for each emotion. This allows us to suggest songs to use that fit your paticular prefence for an emotion.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>Through the course of using the site, we'll track certain pieces of information. For starters, we'll collect a
    username and (optionally) email address from you. We'll also track your votes for songs you browse (whether or not
    you vote them as making you feel an emotion) so we can suggest songs that better match your preference for an emotion.
    If you have any questions about how your data is collected or want to have us purge your information from our records,
    you can email us your request to our webmaster: {% settings 'WEBMASTER_EMAIL' %}.</p>
